## Project Title: Python-RFM-Analysis

**Description**:

In this Python project, I undertook a comprehensive RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on a dataset comprising credit card transactions from the State of Oklahoma. The dataset encompasses purchases made through purchase card programs administered by both the state and higher educational institutions. The project involves the following key components:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Loaded the credit card transactions dataset into Python, exploring its structure and key features.
2. **RFM Metrics Calculation**: Calculated the RFM metrics for each transaction:
  Recency: Determined the time elapsed since the last transaction.
  Frequency: Counted the number of transactions per customer.
  Monetary: Computed the total monetary value of transactions for each customer.
3. **Customer Segmentation**: Segmented customers into distinct groups based on their RFM scores, enabling a nuanced understanding of their purchasing behaviors.
4. **Insight Generation**: Extracted actionable insights from the RFM analysis, identifying high-value customers, at-risk customers, and opportunities for targeted marketing strategies.
5. **Data Visualization**: Utilized Python visualization libraries to create insightful charts and graphs, making it easier to interpret and communicate the findings.
